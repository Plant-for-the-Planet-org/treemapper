    "m_info_n4": "Plot locations need to be chosen at random, including plots near and at the edge of the site. But you do not need to worry about that, since TreeMapper suggests optimal plot locations.\n\n",
    "m_info_h5": " What are control plots?\n",
    "m_info_n5": "Control plots allow you to understand how your site would have developed if you had not planted trees. Therefore we purposefully keep a few sites 'unplanted', register them as control sites and measure what naturally grows there. About 5% of your monitoring plots should have a paired control plot.\n\nThis process is based on XYZ et al. 2022."
