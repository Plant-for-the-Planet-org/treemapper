## Directory Structure

`ios` houses the iOS project files and `android` contains Android project files. The `app` contains the react code base for all platform.

`index.js` is the entry point of both iOS and android platform build process.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add the necessary API keys for your development environment.
Install nvm following instructions from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script
Run `nvm install && nvm use` to install and use required version of node.

## iOS Setup

* Install latest Xcode.
* Run following commands
```
bash
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
cd ios && pod install
```

### Running into iOS simulator

Build and run the app in development mode deployed from Metro Bundler in an iOS simulator (starts Metro Bundler automatically if not already running, also starts iOS simulator):

```
bash
npm run ios
```

If you have problems with a cached version of the bundle, you can stop the Metro Bundler and manually start it with the reset cache option:

```
react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Android Setup

Steps for setting up Dev Env for android on MAC is as follows:

* Install Latest Android Studio.
* From Android studioâ€™s SDK Manager add SDK 28 and Build tool Version 28.0.3
* Install JDK 8 if not already there and set JAVA_HOME specific to your JDK Version (below version number is just an example).
* Create .bash_profile if not already there and add following variables in it:

```
bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home
```

* Run following commands

```
bash
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
```

### Running into Android emulator

Build and run the app in development mode deployed from Metro Bundler (starts Metro Bundler automatically if not already running) on an emulator or device. You need to start an Android emulator or attach a device manually before:

```
bash
npm run android
```

If you have problems with a cached version of the bundle, you can stop the Metro Bundler and manually start it with the reset cache option:

```
react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Development process

This project uses GitFlow (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) with Master-Branch `master` and Development-Branch `develop`.
